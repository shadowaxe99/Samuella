# Architecture

The Samuella project is structured as a collection of Python scripts, each demonstrating a different functionality. The main entry point for the application is the 'main.py' script, which calls functions from the other scripts.

Here is a brief overview of each script:

- `main.py`: This is the main entry point for the application. It calls functions from the other scripts.
- `daily_inspiration.py`: This script contains a function for sending a daily inspiration.
- `sick_mode.py`: This script contains a function for starting a sick mode.
- `family_mode.py`: This script contains a function for handling family messages.
- `leave_message.py`: This script contains functions for leaving and getting messages.
- `schedule_reminder.py`: This script contains a function for scheduling reminders.
- `workout_reminder.py`: This script contains a function for starting a workout mode.
- `calendar_integration.py`: This script contains functions for adding events and getting events.
- `ai_agent.py`: This script contains a function for starting an AI agent.

The 'requirements.txt' file lists the Python packages that are required to run the scripts. These packages can be installed using pip.
